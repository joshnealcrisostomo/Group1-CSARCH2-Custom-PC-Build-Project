## 1. Introduction
This project involves building a custom desktop PC that can handle different general-purpose tasks such as light gaming, productivity tasks, and programming while remaining cost-efficient. The objective is to assemble a well-balanced setup that provides dependable performance without overspending on expensive, high-end parts.

The build was limited by a budget of ₱20,000 (roughly $350 to $400), which guided the decision-making process in selecting appropriate components. By considering compatibility, upgrade potential, and overall value, as well as comparing local Manila and international prices, the group aimed to strike a balance between affordability and functionality.

## 4. Compatibility Justification

- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel Core i3 12100 (LGA1700) works with the Gigabyte H610M K DDR4 LGA1700. The CPU uses the LGA1700, which is supported by the motherboard since it has the LGA1700, ensuring physical compatibility. H610 chipset also supports the 12th Gen Core i3 Intel CPU, making them electronically compatible. Lastly, the motherboard is listed as an H610M model, which denotes its Micro ATX (mATX) form factor, compatible with the mATX case.

- **RAM**: Lexar Thor 8GB Single DDR4 3200MHz Desktop Memory is supported by the Gigabyte H610M K DDR4 motherboard. The motherboard is specified as DDR4, and the chosen RAM is also DDR4, which makes them compatible. The RAM's speed is 3200MHz, which is the standard effective speed for many 12th-gen/H610 configurations, and the motherboard supports this frequency.
  
- **Storage**: Adata Legend 710 512GB PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME 2280 works with Gigabyte H610M K. The motherboard supports NVMe M.2 SSDs. The Adata Legend 710 is an NVMe M.2 2280 drive, which will physically slot into the M.2 port on the motherboard. Since the CPU/Motherboard supports PCIe Gen3/4, the Gen3 SSD is fully compatible, though it runs at a lower speed than newer Gen4 drives.
  
- **PSU**: MSI MAG A550BN Bronze 550W 80+ Power Supply works well with all system components. The 550W rating is sufficient to power the low-to-mid-range components. Since our build does not include a dedicated GPU, 550W is sufficient.
  
- **Case and Form Factors**: Gigabyte H610M K (Motherboard) fits with the Tecware NEO M2 Steel Black Mesh mATX Case. Tecware NEO M2 is a Micro ATX (mATX) case, and the Gigabyte H610M K is an mATX motherboard, ensuring it will fit correctly into the case's standoffs and mounting points. The case provides sufficient clearance for the Intel Laminar RM1 Cooler that comes with the CPU. Lastly, the included 3x120mm Case Fans provide the necessary airflow for cooling the internal components.

## 5. Budget Analysis
The build was completed under the allocated budget, with the final total cost of the selected components amounting to ₱19,370, just below the ₱20,000 budget limit. Careful planning was necessary to divide the funds among the components, ensuring that the most important parts received the largest share.

A significant portion of the budget was allocated to the processor, since it has the biggest impact on overall performance. The group decided not to purchase a dedicated graphics card because of budget constraints, but we made sure to choose a CPU with integrated graphics that can handle light gaming, productivity tasks, and programming. To keep costs manageable, we also picked reliable yet affordable options for the RAM, storage, and motherboard. Additional savings came from using the stock cooler that came with the CPU and choosing a more budget-friendly PC case, which freed up funds for other key parts. At the same time, we selected a slightly higher-wattage power supply to allow for possible upgrades in the future.

By comparing prices from local stores in Manila and international retailers, the group was able to make cost-effective choices without sacrificing essential performance. Overall, the budget allocation shows a balance between affordability and functionality, with savings made primarily in areas that had minimal effect on system capability.
