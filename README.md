## 1. Introduction
This project involves building a custom desktop PC that can handle different general-purpose tasks such as light gaming, productivity tasks, and programming while remaining cost-efficient. The objective is to assemble a well-balanced setup that provides dependable performance without overspending on expensive, high-end parts.

The build was limited by a budget of ₱20,000 (roughly $350 to $400), which guided the decision-making process in selecting appropriate components. By considering compatibility, upgrade potential, and overall value, as well as comparing local Manila and international prices, the group aimed to strike a balance between affordability and functionality.

## 4. Compatibility Justification

- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel Core i3 12100 (LGA1700) works with the Gigabyte H610M K DDR4 LGA1700. The CPU uses the LGA1700, which is supported by the motherboard since it has the LGA1700, ensuring physical compatibility. H610 chipset also supports the 12th Gen Core i3 Intel CPU, making them electronically compatible. Lastly, the motherboard is listed as an H610M model, which denotes its Micro ATX (mATX) form factor, compatible with the mATX case.

- **RAM**: Lexar Thor 8GB Single DDR4 3200MHz Desktop Memory is supported by the Gigabyte H610M K DDR4 motherboard. The motherboard is specified as DDR4, and the chosen RAM is also DDR4, which makes them compatible. The RAM's speed is 3200MHz, which is the standard effective speed for many 12th-gen/H610 configurations, and the motherboard supports this frequency.
  
- **Storage**: Adata Legend 710 512GB PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME 2280 works with Gigabyte H610M K. The motherboard supports NVMe M.2 SSDs. The Adata Legend 710 is an NVMe M.2 2280 drive, which will physically slot into the M.2 port on the motherboard. Since the CPU/Motherboard supports PCIe Gen3/4, the Gen3 SSD is fully compatible, though it runs at a lower speed than newer Gen4 drives.
  
- **PSU**: MSI MAG A550BN Bronze 550W 80+ Power Supply works well with all system components. The 550W rating is sufficient to power the low-to-mid-range components. Since our build does not include a dedicated GPU, 550W is sufficient.
  
- **Case and Form Factors**: Gigabyte H610M K (Motherboard) fits with the Tecware NEO M2 Steel Black Mesh mATX Case. Tecware NEO M2 is a Micro ATX (mATX) case, and the Gigabyte H610M K is an mATX motherboard, ensuring it will fit correctly into the case's standoffs and mounting points. The case provides sufficient clearance for the Intel Laminar RM1 Cooler that comes with the CPU. Lastly, the included 3x120mm Case Fans provide the necessary airflow for cooling the internal components.

## 5. Budget Analysis
The build was completed under the allocated budget, with the final total cost of the selected components amounting to ₱19,370, just below the ₱20,000 budget limit. Careful planning was necessary to divide the funds among the components, ensuring that the most important parts received the largest share.

A significant portion of the budget was allocated to the processor, since it plays the biggest role in overall performance. Because of budget constraints, the group decided not to purchase a dedicated graphics card and instead relied on the Intel Core i3-12100’s integrated graphics, which can still handle light gaming, programming, and productivity tasks. For the other parts, we chose affordable but reliable RAM, storage, and motherboard options to stay on budget. We also saved by using the stock Intel Laminar cooler that came with the CPU and by selecting a budget-friendly case that already included fans, which avoided extra costs. On the other hand, we invested in a slightly higher-wattage 550W power supply to leave room for possible upgrades in the future.

By comparing prices from local stores in Manila and international retailers, the group was able to make cost-effective choices without sacrificing essential performance. Overall, the budget allocation shows a balance between affordability and functionality, with trade-offs made in areas that had little impact on the PC’s capability.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)
Our research  showed that PC components are generally more expensive when purchased from international vendors compared to local Manila suppliers. For example, high-end GPUs and SSDs from international stores often include additional shipping fees, import taxes, and handling charges, which can  increase the final cost. The conversion from US dollars to Philippine pesos also often makes these components even more expensive for us, whereas in the United States, the same parts are relatively cheaper for local buyers. Conversely, local vendors sometimes offer competitive prices due to lower shipping costs and occasional promotional discounts. We noticed this when building our draft build on pc part picker as it was more expensive than our local build table. However, it is also notable that some of the latest gen specs may not be readily available locally, forcing us to purchase from international suppliers at a higher price.

- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents
We observed that international vendors tend to have a wider selection and higher availability of components, especially for latest gen specs. For example, In our draft build we opted for the MSI PRO H610M-G but that exact model wasnt available here so we had to substitute it with Gigabyte H610M which carries the same compatibility. This shows that locally, while stock levels for mainstream parts like RAM, SSDs, and CPUs are generally stable, finding cheaper alternatives or specific models can be difficult. The MCO specifications also mention that the parts should be latest gen parts (2024-2025) however this would create a huge increase in price and leave us outside of our budget. We opted to pick older motherboard types (LGA1700) compared to the newest ones (LGA1851) since that would force us to purchase the latest gen CPU's when we dont need a better one. There is a trade-off between availability and cost, exemplifying the importance of planning and sourcing in PC building.

- What the group learned about PC components and system design
Through this activity, our group gained a deeper understanding of PC components and how they interact within a system. We learned that compatibility is critical. Choosing a motherboard that supports a particular CPU and RAM type, ensuring power supply capacity matches component demands, and considering cooling requirements are all essential for a functional and stable build. Additionally, we realized that optimizing a system for performance and cost-efficiency requires careful selection of parts: balancing speed, storage, and graphics performance without overspending. We learned about bottlenecks and that pairing a high-end GPU with a low-end CPU is inefficient, while investing in high-speed RAM may not significantly improve performance if the CPU cannot fully utilize it. We also learned how important the purpose of the PC strongly affects part selection. Since our build focused on intel budget gaming, we prioritized a decent CPU that can handle low end games and opted out of a GPU. Based on a benchmark video it can run GTA 5 at an average of 70 fps so it should have no problems running games like League of legends or valorant. If our PC was intended for office work, media editing, or server tasks, our component choices would have been different, with more emphasis on storage or energy efficiency.

This exercise reinforced that building a PC is not just about picking the most expensive or powerful components, but about strategic planning, understanding hardware compatibility, and making informed trade-offs between cost, performance, and availability. We also learned the importance of keeping track of market prices and stock levels, both locally and internationally, to maximize value for money.
